The OpenCV Python Doc repository is a project aiming to document the entirety of OpenCV's Python binding. Every class and function will have:

- Behavior described to the fullest extent
- Inputs and outputs clearly defined
- Sample code to demonstrate specifically how to use different components

```python
print("hello, world!")
```
