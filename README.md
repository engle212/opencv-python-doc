# OpenCV-Python-Doc
The OpenCV Python Doc repository is a project aiming to document the entirety of OpenCV's Python binding. Every class and function will have:

- Behavior described to the fullest extent
- Inputs and outputs clearly defined
- Sample code to demonstrate specifically how to use different components
